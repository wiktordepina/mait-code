"""The mait-code brand moment — wordmark, signature glyph, companion voice.

Pure data and string/Rich helpers (no Textual import — safe anywhere, like
:mod:`~mait_code.tui.palette`). The wordmark is a block-shadow rendering of the
name — bold filled glyphs for a confident brand moment — with a plain-text
fallback for terminals too narrow to hold the art. :func:`wordmark_text`
paints it in the house treatment: a horizontal brand-palette gradient across
the fills, the drop shadow dimmed toward the background so it reads as depth.

The signature glyph (:data:`GLYPH`) is the companion's marker — it leads
every empty-state line (via :func:`empty_state`) so a quiet screen still
sounds like the companion rather than a bare "no data".
